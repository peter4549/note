## What is Modal?
The idea is to put the user in a different ‘mode’ hence the name Modal. Also, the user can switch back to the previous mode at any time. In android, we use *Dialogs* as the base of modal windows.

## What is Persistent BottomSheet?
This lets you interact with not just a BottomSheet alone. This also uses a dialog underneath so none of your knowledge is gonna get wasted. But in addition to `BottomSheetDialog` it uses a fragment that wraps the dialog inside it. One analogy for the persistent Bottom sheet is that it can save the state of the bottom sheet itself hence, the name *persistent*.

## Lifecycle
```
onCreate -> onCreateDialog -> onCreateView
```

## Tricks
>You might be wondering how to make the BottomSheet.STATE_EXPANDED cover the full screen even if the content inside it isn’t enough to do so (by suppose using a NestedScrollingView with fillViewPort=”true”) because if you try to do so by behavior.state=BottomSheetBehavior.STATE_EXPANDED it won’t. This happens because the minimum height of the parent in which the inflated view resides need to be set equal to the height of the display itself. This can be done simply using:-
