## What is Modal?
The idea is to put the user in a different ‘mode’ hence the name Modal. Also, the user can switch back to the previous mode at any time. In android, we use *Dialogs* as the base of modal windows.

## What is Persistent BottomSheet?
This lets you interact with not just a BottomSheet alone. This also uses a dialog underneath so none of your knowledge is gonna get wasted. But in addition to `BottomSheetDialog` it uses a fragment that wraps the dialog inside it. One analogy for the persistent Bottom sheet is that it can save the state of the bottom sheet itself hence, the name *persistent*.

## Lifecycle
