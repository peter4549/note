# @Volatile
This helps us make sure the value of INSTANCE is always up to date and the same to all excution threats.  
The value of a volatile variable will never be cached, and all writes and reads will be done to and from the main memory,
it means that changes made by one thread to INSTANCE are visible to all other threads immediately.
